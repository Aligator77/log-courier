Packaging Instructions
======================

Install required package building packages

    sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper golang-go

Copy the contrib/deb folder to the project root.
Then run the packaging command

    dpkg-buildpackage

Packaging on Wheezy
===================

The version of 'go' available in the golang-go package available in Debian
wheezy is not recent enough to build this package. The following procedure
can be followed as a workaround.

First, grab the latest go from https://golang.org/ and install as standard in
/usr/local/go (debian's current packaged version is not new enough).

Add go to the PATH

    export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH

Build the packages as normal

Building a Source DEB
=====================

Follow the instructions for a regular package using the following command
instead of dpkg-buildpackage

    debuild -S -uc

To switch lintian profile during build:

    debuild -S -uc --lintian-opts --profile debian
