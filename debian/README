To build the debian package on wheezy
=====================================

The version of 'go' available in the golang-go package available in Debian
wheezy is not recent enough to build this package. The following procedure
can be followed as a workaround.

First, grab the latest go from https://golang.org/ and install as standard in
/usr/local/go (debian's current packaged version is not new enough).

Add go to the PATH

    $ export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH

Build the packages

    $ dpkg-buildpackage
